      <h3>Let's begin</h3>
      <p><strong>Parenting is hard!! (Say it louder for the people in the back!).</strong></p>
      <p><strong>If you've been personally victimized by a toddler's blood-curdling screams. If you have planned an entire list of errands to run while the children nap, but just fell asleep on the couch instead. If your kids would rather eat their boogers than the meals you work so hard to plan and make. Just know this: you are not alone!!</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>I have 4 kids. They are really great kids. If we're talking about winning the kid lottery, I'm pretty sure I won. Or at least I was a close runner-up. I love them dearly. But that doesn't mean it's not hard and extremely exhausting. I honestly wouldn't say I'm particularly good at this mothering gig I'm forced to perform every day, but I sure am trying.</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>I am here to help lighten the load, provide support and solidarity. We are in this together and might as well help each other out. No judgment. No shaming. No snarky remarks. We're doing the best we can with the tools we have been given. My goal is to give you just a few more tools. </strong></p>

      <h4>About Me </h4>
      <p>I'm a tired mom of four little kids, ages 8, 6, 3, and 1. I have dreamed of being a mother since I was a teenager. But when my dream became a reality at 32 years old, it was an eye opening experience. I worked full time for the first 6 years of motherhood, but now I stay at home raising my little munchkins. </p>
