      <p>TIMERS</p>
      <p><strong>Let's face it, cleaning sucks! </strong></p>
      <p>My house is almost never clean. It just isn't. And guess what! It's okay for your hosue to look like people live there, because they do.</p>
      <p>But, I have a few tricks to make cleaning a little less daunting.</p>
      <p>When I'm feeling overwhelmed by the mess and I just don't know where to start, all I can do is start. Sounds weird, huh? Well, it's never going to get done if you don't start at all. But here's the trick: don't do it all at once! If you start with the the goal to clean EVERYTHING, then either nothing will get done, or you'll lose your $*&gt;t. </p>
      <p>First, make sure the kids are occupied. Next, set a timer. It can be 10 or 15 minutes, but make sure it's a small amount of time. Then, see how much you can get done in that much time. When the timer goes off, you're done! Step away from cleaning and take a break.</p>
      <p>I do this three to four times during the day. By cleaning in smaller increments, the cleaning seems much more doable. </p>
      <p><strong>Pro-tip</strong></p>
      <p>When doing a task, such as doing the dishes, set a timer. See how fast you can do it. You'll be surprised how quickly it actually goes by and realize it's really not that bad. <img src="images/stop-watch-396862__480.jpeg" width="322" height="196" alt=""></p>

      <h4>About Me </h4>
      <p>I'm a tired mom of four little kids, ages 8, 6, 3, and 1. I have dreamed of being a mother since I was a teenager. But when my dream became a reality at 32 years old, it was an eye opening experience. I worked full time for the first 6 years of motherhood, but now I stay at home raising my little munchkins.</p>
