      <h3>Feeding Kids</h3>
      <p><strong>Figuring out what to feed all of the humans in your house for three meals a day for the rest of your life?  Sounds fun!</strong></p>
      <p><strong>I used to get excited thinking about cooking for my family. The thought of making nutritious and delicious meals excited me! I love to cook!  Now? It's probably my least facorite thing to do.  my kids are picky. I have to pull teeth to get my kids to even lick a vegetable. My goal though is to make sure they are eating some sort of plant at least two meals a day.  It doesn't matter if it's a fruit or a vegatable.  If it is made of plant cells, it's a win!</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>Something that experts might not recommend, but I highly recommend, is hiding the vegetables. Chocolate zucchini bread is a win in my book!  I have also blended up beets in their pancakes and made "pink" pancakes.  I'm such a fun mom!!</strong></p>
      <br>
      <p><strong>The honest truth is that if you are at least trying and are concerned, you're a good parent.  If your kids are still alive because you're giving them enough food, you're a good parent.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>Here is one of my favorite recipes.  Not too much sugar, packed full of zucchini, and my kids gobble it right up. <a href="https://www.yummytoddlerfood.com/chocolate-zucchini-muffins-with-blueberries/">Chocolate Chip Zucchini Bread (cake)</a></strong></p>

      <h4>About Me </h4>
      <p>I'm a tired mom of four little kids, ages 8, 6, 3, and 1. I have dreamed of being a mother since I was a teenager. But when my dream became a reality at 32 years old, it was an eye opening experience. I worked full time for the first 6 years of motherhood, but now I stay at home raising my little munchkins.</p>
